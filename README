                   Release of version 1.12 of Acme::Bleach
==============================================================================


NAME
    Acme::Bleach - For *really* clean programs

SYNOPSIS
            use Acme::Bleach;

            print "Hello world";

DESCRIPTION
    The first time you run a program under `use Acme::Bleach', the
    module removes all the unsightly printable characters from your
    source file. The code continues to work exactly as it did before,
    but now it looks like this:

            use Acme::Bleach;
                                                                                             
INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file in its appropriate
    local Perl subdirectory.
